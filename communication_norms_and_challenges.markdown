####Quotes to Keep in Mind:

* "One of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say." - Bryant H. McGill
* "When we listen to people there is an alternating current, and this recharges us so that we never get tired of each other. We are constantly being re-created. There is this little creative fountain inside us that begins to spring and cast up new thoughts and unexpected laughter and wisdom. ... That is why, when someone has listened to you, you go home rested and lighthearted. It is when people really listen to us, with quiet fascinated attention, that the little fountain begins to work again, to accelerate in the most surprising way." -Brenda Ueland
* "The greatest compliment that was ever paid me was when one asked me what I thought, and attended to my answer." â€” Henry David Thoreau
